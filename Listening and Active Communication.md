# Listening and Active Communication

### Q) What are the steps or strategies for active listening?
- By avoiding getting distracted by your own thoughts.
- Try not to interrupt the other person; let them finish, and then respond.
- Use door openers so that other people can confirm that you are interested in their talk.
- Show that you are listening through your body language.
- Take notes, storing important conversations.

Key points:
- Empathy: understanding the speaker’s emotions and thoughts and showing empathy towards their feelings and experiences
- Clarification and Validation: Clarifying the speaker if any points are not clear and confirming their experiences and emotions
- Reiteration of content: summarizing the speaker’s main points to ensure understanding and make them feel heard and understood.

Some barriers to listening are:
- Difficulty in understanding others’s perspectives
