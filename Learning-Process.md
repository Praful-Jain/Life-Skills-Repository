# Learning Process


### Q) What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
If you are willing to understand a concept, just explain it to someone. Take a paper, write the name of the topic you are learning on the top of the page, explain the concept in simple language, and work through examples. Identify any area in which you are weak, work hard on it, and then challenge yourself to simplify what you have written on that piece of paper. Remember, converting a concept into its simplest form is a great art, which will make your learning more efficient and less time-consuming.


### Q) In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting ideas for me are:
- While solving any problem or learning a concept, if you get stuck somewhere, try to turn your attention away from that problem and shift to diffuse mode (resting state), because in this mode people come up with new ideas that they found hard to come up with in focus mode.

- If you want to overcome the habit of procrastination, the best way is to keep working through it, and in a second it will dissipate. One can overcome procrastination with the Pomodoro Technique, which states that just try to work with focus for 25 minutes, then take a break of a few minutes to have fun. That's how you can enhance your ability to have focused attention, and at the same time, you’ll find that relaxation is also an important part of the learning process.

- Moving slowly but in the right direction is not bad, but what is bad is moving in the wrong direction. Whenever you learn something, try to recall it. Learning how to learn is the most powerful tool you can ever grasp.


### Q) What are active and di   ffuse modes of thinking?
Active mode: In active mode, we turn our attention to something we are learning or working on.
Diffused mode: It is a resting state in which we do relax, and by doing so, many people have found that it evolves new ideas into our minds.


## Q) According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
Steps to take when approaching a new topic:
- Deconstruct the skill.
- Learn enough to self-correct.
- Remove proactive barriers.
- Practice for at least 20 hours.
- Every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end.


### Q) What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- I practice things again and again until I have mastered them.
- Stay away from distractions.
- Develop the habit of doing my work with full attention.
- Taking good sleep
- Doing fun activities at regular intervals.
